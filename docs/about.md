At this time, I am a Software Engineer at Thales Avionics, while also being the owner [Otimbi Labs](https://www.otimbilabs.com/) & former CEO & founder of [Wi Pay](https://wipay.africa/); Co-founder and former CTO of [Beep Taxis](http://beeptaxis.com/).

I love building & discovering things. This is my blog, I share random thoughts and my journey as an entrepreneur.

I mainly write about engineering, machine learning, psychology and economy/economics, and other topics that I am passionate about.

Other than that, I read books and I love sharing my insights about them, I mostly do that through Instagram ;)
